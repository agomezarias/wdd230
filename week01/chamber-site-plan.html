            <h2>Site Name: Aurora Chamber of Commerce</h2>
            <p>Aurora Colorado is the city in which I grew up in and it would be helpful to have a chamber of commerce
                specifically geared or focused on helping minority groups.
            </p>

        <div id="sitePurpose">
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The main purpose or focus of this particular chamber of commerce would be to better inform and
                communicate
                ways in which people could progress by forming a community in which services would help small family
                owned
                businesses in the area.
            </p>

        <div id="scenarios">
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>Community events such as a small festival or fair can be used to help small businesses market their
                products or services. It can also help other business owners with similar interests meet each outher and
                offer each others services. Contact information could be in an about us page. Pupulation growth expected
                to be about 1.9 percent in the area.
