            <h2>Site Name: Aurora Chamber of Commerce</h2>
            <p>Aurora Colorado is the city in which I grew up in and it would be helpful to have a chamber of commerce
                specifically geared or focused on helping minority groups.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="site-purpose">
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The main purpose or focus of this particular chamber of commerce would be to better inform and
                communicate ways in which people could progress by forming a community that will help small family
                owned businesses in the area. Another purpose would be to communicate important events such as voting
                days, or special events in the community.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="scenarios">
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>Community events such as a small festival or fair can be used to help small businesses market their
                products or services. It can also help other business owners with similar interests meet each outher and
                offer each others services. Contact information could be in an about us page. Pupulation growth expected
                to be about 1.9 percent in the area. Someone new to the site could inform said person about ways to
                improve themselves and the community. 3 target audiences are anyone who pays taxes and would like to
                know where
                their funds are being spent. Voters who would like to induct someone who is more in line with their
                interests,
                and parents of children who would like to keep a safe community.
            </p>
