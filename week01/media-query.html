            <h2>Ether 12:4</h2>
            <p>
                4. Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better
                world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh
                of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them
                sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to
                glorify God.

            <h2>Alma 7:11-12</h2>
            <p>
                11. And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that
                the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his
                people.
                12. And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he
                will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh,
                that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.
